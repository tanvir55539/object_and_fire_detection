# object_and_fire_detection
Using this code you can detect objects (based on the coco data set) and you can detect fire as well (if you press the button 'f' of your keyboard).
For video streaming, we have used the esp-32 cam module (for video streaming you have to set up the esp-32 cam first by uploading the specific sketch to the esp-32 cam)
before running the code you have to set up all the things you need;-,
and when you are ok to go and run the program the esp32 cam will start to stream and it will detect objects, and when it detects any person or human it will take a picture 
of the person and upload it to Google Drive by it self.

**Setup**:
Complete the [setup](https://how2electronics.com/esp32-cam-based-object-detection-identification-with-opencv/).
**Note**: complete the full tutorial from the link but use the Python code that is given in this GitHub repository instead of the link. 

For Setting up the Google Drive API follow this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/1Lu8FwC2CWQ).
