# object_and_fire_detection
Using this code you can detect object (based on coco data set) and you can detect fire as well (if you press the button 'f' of your keyboard).
For video streming we have used esp-32 cam modual (for video streaming you have to set up the esp-32 cam first by uploading specific sketch to the esp-32 cam)
before running the code you have to set up all the things you need;-,
and when you are ok to go, and run the program the esp32 cam will strat to stream and it will detect object and when it detect any person or human it will take a picture 
of the pesron and upload it to google drive by it self.
